        <h3>Required ingregients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Large eggs</li>
            <li>5 ounces spinach</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of flour</li>
            <li>0.625 cups of semolina flour</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Cooking steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth.</li>
            <li>Finish ragu: Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the béchamel, 1/3 of the ricotta, and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining béchamel and Parmesan; dot with butter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
